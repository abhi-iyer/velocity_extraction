**_Instructions_**
`runner.py` allows the user to run various experiments. Each experiment can be parameterized through a "config", which is contained in `configs.py`. The analysis scripts (e.g., `analysis_bird2d.ipynb`) provide code for generating paper figures and running analyses within each "abstract domain".
